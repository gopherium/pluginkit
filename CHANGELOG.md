# Changelog

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-14

- `wire.Config` gains an optional `Roots` list naming the plugin root
  directories scanned in order, defaulting to `plugins`. An id present
  in more than one root is rejected.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-05

- New optional `Seeder` capability, `Seed(ctx) error`, for plugins that can
  fill their own schema with development data.
- `Host.Seed` asks every `Seeder` in registration order and stops at the
  first failure, with the same panic isolation as the other host calls.
  Seeding stays outside `Start`, so booting never writes sample data.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-26

- `wire.Config` gains an optional `TSLicense` field for applications whose
  generated TypeScript wiring carries a different license than the Go one.
  It defaults to `License` when empty.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-26

Initial release:

- Lifecycle contract: `Plugin`, `Migrator`, `RouteProvider`,
  `PublicPathProvider`.
- `Host`: migrate-before-start, in-order start with reverse-order stop,
  rollback on failed start, panic isolation per plugin call.
- `Protect`: exact-match public-path passthrough around caller-supplied
  middleware.
- `wire`: plugin manifest loading/validation and Go + TypeScript wiring
  generation, parameterized by the consuming application.
